# Meta-meta-learning with evolution and plasticity

This is the code for the arxiv preprint [Learning to acquire novel cognitive tasks with evolution,
plasticity and meta-meta-learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08588).

We evolve plastic (i.e. self-modifying) neural networks, that can automatically acquire *novel* cognitive (meta-learning) tasks, not seen during training,  from stimuli and rewards alone.

**Note**: This code is currently being revised. 

The code is in the form of Jupyter notebooks that can be run on Google Colab. 
It is **strongly** recommended to consult the `Simple` notebook, which contains a simplified version of the code that should be easier to read through, while still producing the same results. 
The other notebook contains the full code that was actually used to run the experiments.
