# MetaMetaLearning
Evolve plastic networks to be able to automatically acquire novel meta-learning (cognitive) tasks

This is the code for the arxiv preprint [Learning to acquire novel cognitive tasks with evolution,
plasticity and meta-meta-learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08588).

The code is in the form of Jupyter notebooks that can be run on Google Colab. 
It is **strongly** recommended to consult the `Simple` notebook, which contains a simplified version of the code that should be easier to read through. 
The other notebook contains the full code that was actually used to run the experiments.
